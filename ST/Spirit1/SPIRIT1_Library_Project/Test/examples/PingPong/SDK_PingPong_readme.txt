@par Example Description

This examples explains how to configure one node as a transmitter and
the other as a receiver in order to do a simple basic packet transmission.
There are to devices, A and B. Each one switches between TX and RX
periodically, in order to transmit the same data previously received.
The leds on board are toggled in order to LED1 is toggled on a TX_DATA_DONE IRQ and LED2 is toggled on a
RX_DATA_READY IRQ.
Moreover a Virtual Com stream can be opened by defining the preprocessing
environment variable USE_VCOM. In this case both the transmitter and
the receiver will write the ball buffer on video every time a Tx or an
Rx is performed.

@par Hardware and Software environment


  - This example runs on STM32L1xx Ultra Low Power Medium-Density Devices.

  - This example has been tested with STMicroelectronics SDK-EVAL evaluation
    board and can be easily tailored to any other supported device and
    development board.

  - SPIRIT Set-up
    - Connect SPIRIT to the SPI connectors in the SDK-EVAL board.

@par How to use it ?

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
 - Open your preferred toolchain and import the .c files in your workspace
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
 - Run the example

@note
- Ultra Low Power Medium-density devices are STM32L151xx and STM32L152xx
  microcontrollers where the Flash memory density ranges between 64 and 128 Kbytes.
